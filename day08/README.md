Now it's necessary to do the same, but with several nodes at the same time, and only stop when all of them are in a goal position. It seems straightforward but running it takes forever...

I had to find the "rule" for each node and apply least common multiple (is that so in English?). Credit for lcm function is not mine, too lazy to re-implement it.
