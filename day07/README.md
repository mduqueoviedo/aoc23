## First star

This challenge is very intimidating at first, because it's kinda long. Divide and conquer!

I wrote 3 modules and created some constants so each task would be performed separately: Get type of hand, compare hands, run comparison of hands of same type...

This way I got to the solution almost at the first try (I had a typo in one of the modules).

I also got scared by the hand type calculation, I solved that using Sets.

## Second star

I have struggled a little bit with the second part, but thanks to having so many functions it was not that hard. It's just that the modules were depending on each other _a little bit_ instead of being totally modular.

The gotcha part of the problem is that hands with many J can create new hands on their own.
