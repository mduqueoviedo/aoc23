## First star

I see this challenge and already trembling about part 2. First part is looping back and forth, generating new sequences on the while.

## Second star

Oh, but I was wrong for once!

My solution from part 1 almost worked, it seems I was using the correct data structures, as I only had to add the new elements at the beginning of the sequence. So they are almost identical.
