## First star

I found this problem a bit messy to write into code. It's actually just my lazyness, because it's not that hard.

HOWEVER! Once test input works and you move to real input, my solution broke the memory. I was applying the mapping to the whole ranges, when (among another million options) you can just mark beginning and end of ranges, as well the difference with the destination.

Functions help a lot and I am sure I can remove the repeated mapping into one, but it's AoC, no need to linger for too long here.

## Second star

I was expecting a similar issue with the second star. The looping is even more intense, so the memory cannot do this. I must find a way to skip steps.
