## First star

Wow, just wow. Day 3 and it was a struggle.

Firstly I was not checking adjacents correctly, my fault. But then, for the second time, test input was not enough for me. I was missing the numbers at the very end of the lines. That's also my fault, and technically it's not in the test input but it's in the statement.

## Second star

I am a bit ashamed to say that my solution works but have no 100% over how it works. It's not like I've asked ChatGPT or cheated in some forum, honestly! However, I was stubborn to reuse the first star solution, that in this case it doesn't seem the best approach.

I scanned the engine looking for the numbers, at the same time I was checking whether those numbers had a star adjacent to them. This was not working entirely right because looping over looping over looping is very difficult to debug in big entries (test input was working for me, sigh).

Probably, looking for the stars and finding the adjacent numbers would've been smarter.
